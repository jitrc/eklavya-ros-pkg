Introduction
------------
Design of the Eklavya series had started in the month of June of 2011. With an aim to send this vehicle to IGVC, several designs were weighed against each other. The team ultimately went with a sturdy skid steer mechanism implemented on Eklavya 1.0 for the IGVC 2012.

After the competition, the team decided to improvise the 1.0 platform with some changes in its mechanical design leading to Eklavya 1.1, which is almost half as heavy as its predecessor and still be able to carry the 10 Kg payload. Most of the software improvements are developed and tested on this platform.
